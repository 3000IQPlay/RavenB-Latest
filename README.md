# Why?
The dev is retarded, continues to paste public code into his dogshit client, aswell as for practice in reverse engineering.

since the last crack the dev managed to use the same public Bozar (Bozo) obfuscator aswell as Scuti (Scummy).

apart from that in terms of security absolutely nothing was changed.
